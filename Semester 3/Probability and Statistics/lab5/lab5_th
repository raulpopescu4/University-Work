Confidence Internals
	X - charactheristic of a pop.
	    -it has a pdf: fx(x, theta) theta - unkwon parameters = target parameters

	Goal: estimate theta
	Make a selection of volum n
	=> obtain X1, X2, X3, ..., Xn  sel. variables
	that are indep & ident. distrib. with X
	(X1, X2, ..., Xn have the same pdf as X)


Methods:
	1. use a sel. function
	bar theta = bar theta(X1, X2, ..., Xn)

	2. find (bar theta l), (bar theta h) such that P((bar theta l) < theta < (bar theta h)) = 1 - alpha


Therminology:
	((bar theta l), (bar theta h)) - 100(1 - alpha)% CI for theta
	1 - alpha = confidence level/ coeff
	alpha = significance level (L6)

	Usually 1 - alpha belongs to [0, 1] but we take the values 0,95 - 0,99


	x = vector of data/ sample
	n = sample size (length(x))
	miu = population mean (theoretical mean)
	bar x = sample mean (mean(x))
	sigma squared = population variance 
	s squared = sample variance (var(x))
	sigma = population std. dev.
	s = sample std. dev (std(x))

	quantiles:
		Z alpha - quantile of order 
		alpha of the N(0, 1) law
		
		kai squared(X)n - quantile of order n of the chai squared
